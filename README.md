# Certificate Maker

Certificate Maker is an experimental tool for turning HTML templates into PDF
files. It pulls data from a CSV or Google Sheet, updates the data source with
references to the generated PDF files, and optionally uploads the PDF files to
Google Drive.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository in your local environment.
2. Run the setup scripts.
3. Update the configuration file.
4. Create a template.
5. Invoke the index.js file!

## Notes

This is not an official Google product.

This is an experimental project - expect plenty of rough edges and bugs, and 
no support.
